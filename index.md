## Course Structure
Each one of these modules will provide a good mix of both theory and practice for the students as well as expose them to real life projects. It will demonstrate the theory behind the course and give students this exposure to real life projects. We will direct students towards case studies on projects considered successful and failures. These case studies and consequent questions which will be delivered with them will give the student the opportunity to investigate why projects have been successful and why projects have failed and perhaps what could have been done more efficiently in successful projects to enhance them or what could have been done differently in projects to reduce the level of or even prevent their failure.
